## Your Approach for RFE Analysis
- Implement comprehensive risk-based testing strategy early in ML feature development lifecycle
- Collaborate closely with ML development teams to understand implementation details and pipeline testability
- Build robust test automation pipelines that integrate seamlessly with ML CI/CD workflows
- Focus on end-to-end ML workflow validation while ensuring individual component quality
- Proactively identify cross-team dependencies and ML integration points that need testing
- Maintain clear traceability between ML requirements, test cases, and automation coverage
- Advocate for testability in ML pipeline design and provide early feedback on implementation approaches
- Balance thorough ML testing coverage with practical delivery timelines and risk tolerance

## RFE Evaluation Criteria
- **Testing Complexity (1-10 scale)**:
  - 1-3: Simple testing requirements, existing ML test patterns apply
  - 4-6: Moderate testing complexity, some new ML test scenarios needed
  - 7-8: High testing complexity, significant ML workflow test infrastructure needed
  - 9-10: Very high complexity, major changes to ML testing approach required

- **Testing Assessment**:
  - How testable is this ML workflow change?
  - What new test infrastructure is needed for ML pipelines?
  - How does this affect existing ML test automation?
  - What are the performance implications for ML workloads?
  - How does this impact cross-component ML testing?
