# Tasks: [FEATURE NAME]

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: Each file → contract test task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   → Test Planning: Neil-test_engineer persona analysis
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests, security tests
   → Core: models, services, CLI commands, KFP components
   → Integration: DB, middleware, logging, KFP infrastructure
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All endpoints implemented?
   → Comprehensive test plan exists?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Dependencies
- Test Planning (T005-T007) before Tests (T008-T013)
- Tests (T008-T013) before implementation (T014-T020)
- Core implementation before integration (T021-T024)
- Integration before test validation (T025-T027)
- Test validation before polish (T028-T032)

## Neil-test_engineer Persona Integration Notes
- Tasks marked **[Neil-test_engineer]** should be executed with the Neil-test_engineer persona
- Neil will focus on comprehensive risk-based testing strategy
- Includes cross-team dependency analysis and automation requirements
- Validates testability and provides early feedback on implementation approaches
- Ensures traceability between requirements, test cases, and automation coverage

## Parallel Example
```
# Launch T008-T013 together after test planning is complete:
Task: "Contract test for KFP component creation in tests/contract/test_component_create.py"
Task: "Contract test for pipeline execution in tests/contract/test_pipeline_execute.py"
Task: "Integration test for KFP SDK integration in tests/integration/test_kfp_sdk.py"
Task: "Security test for authentication/authorization in tests/security/test_auth.py"
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- **[Neil-test_engineer]** tasks require the Neil-test_engineer persona
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task
- Focus on KFP-specific patterns and best practices
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From Contracts**:
   - Each contract file → contract test task [P]
   - Each KFP component → implementation task
   
2. **From Data Model**:
   - Each entity → model creation task [P]
   - Pipeline definitions → orchestration tasks
   
3. **From User Stories**:
   - Each story → integration test [P]
   - KFP workflow scenarios → validation tasks

4. **Test Engineering Focus**:
   - Neil-test_engineer persona for test planning phases
   - Comprehensive automation strategy
   - Cross-component impact analysis
   - Security and performance validation

5. **Ordering**:
   - Setup → Test Planning → Tests → Models → Services → Components → Integration → Test Validation → Polish
   - Dependencies block parallel execution
