# ML Pipeline Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`
**Created**: [DATE]
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: ML feature description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse ML feature description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No ML pipeline feature description provided"
2. Extract key ML concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: ML workflows, pipeline components, data artifacts, performance constraints
3. For each unclear ML aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific ML question]
4. Fill ML User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear ML workflow: ERROR "Cannot determine ML pipeline scenarios"
5. Generate ML Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable in KFP environment
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous ML requirements
6. Identify Key ML Entities (pipeline components, artifacts, metadata)
7. Run ML Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "ML spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (ML spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines for ML Pipeline Features
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT ML users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no specific ML frameworks, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for ML practitioners and platform stakeholders, not developers
- ü§ñ Consider data scientists, ML engineers, and platform operators as primary users

### Section Requirements for ML Features
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every ML pipeline feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the ML feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation of ML Specs
When creating this ML spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ML ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific ML question] for any assumption
2. **Don't guess ML specifics**: If the prompt doesn't specify (e.g., "model training" without framework), mark it
3. **Think like an ML tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable in KFP environment" checklist
4. **Common underspecified ML areas**:
   - ML framework compatibility requirements
   - Resource requirements (CPU, memory, GPU)
   - Pipeline scalability and performance targets
   - Model versioning and artifact management
   - Integration with existing ML infrastructure
   - Security/compliance needs for ML data and models

## ML User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary ML User Story
[Describe the main ML workflow journey in plain language - data scientist to model deployment]

### ML Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** [ML pipeline state], **When** [ML action], **Then** [expected ML outcome]
2. **Given** [model training scenario], **When** [pipeline execution], **Then** [expected artifacts and metadata]
3. **Given** [ML infrastructure state], **When** [resource constraints], **Then** [expected scaling behavior]

### ML Edge Cases
- What happens when [ML pipeline component fails]?
- How does system handle [large dataset or model size]?
- What occurs during [resource exhaustion or GPU unavailability]?
- How does pipeline behave with [incompatible ML framework versions]?

## ML Pipeline Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements for ML Workflows
- **FR-001**: Pipeline MUST [specific ML capability, e.g., "support TensorFlow model training components"]
- **FR-002**: System MUST [ML data handling, e.g., "validate input data schemas for pipeline components"]
- **FR-003**: ML users MUST be able to [key ML interaction, e.g., "monitor pipeline execution progress and metrics"]
- **FR-004**: Pipeline MUST [ML artifact requirement, e.g., "persist model artifacts with versioning metadata"]
- **FR-005**: System MUST [ML behavior, e.g., "log all pipeline execution events and resource usage"]

*Example of marking unclear ML requirements:*
- **FR-006**: Pipeline MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ML frameworks not specified - TensorFlow, PyTorch, XGBoost, scikit-learn?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST retain ML artifacts for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period for models and datasets not specified]
- **FR-008**: Pipeline MUST scale to [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: concurrent execution limits and resource requirements not defined]

### Non-Functional Requirements for ML Platform
- **NFR-001**: Pipeline execution MUST complete within [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: acceptable latency not specified]
- **NFR-002**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: concurrent pipeline limit not specified] simultaneous executions
- **NFR-003**: ML artifacts MUST be accessible across [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: multi-tenancy requirements not defined]
- **NFR-004**: Pipeline MUST integrate with existing [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: required integrations not specified]

### Key ML Entities *(include if feature involves ML data/components)*
- **Pipeline Component**: [What ML operation it performs, input/output specifications]
- **ML Artifact**: [What model or data it represents, versioning and lineage requirements]
- **Execution Metadata**: [What pipeline information it captures, relationships to components]
- **Resource Specification**: [What computational requirements it defines, scaling parameters]

---

## ML Platform Integration *(include if applicable)*

### KFP Integration Points
- **SDK Integration**: [How feature integrates with KFP Python SDK]
- **API Server Integration**: [Required API changes or extensions]
- **Metadata Store**: [How feature uses or extends ML metadata]
- **UI Integration**: [Pipeline authoring or monitoring UI changes]

### External ML Dependencies
- **ML Frameworks**: [Required ML library versions and compatibility]
- **Container Runtime**: [Special container or image requirements]
- **Resource Management**: [GPU, storage, or networking requirements]
- **Data Storage**: [Integration with data lakes, databases, or artifact stores]
