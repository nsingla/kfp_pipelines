# ML Pipeline Tasks: [FEATURE NAME]

**Input**: ML design documents from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), ml-research.md, ml-data-model.md, ml-contracts/

## Execution Flow (main) for ML Features
```
1. Load plan.md from ML feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No ML implementation plan found"
   → Extract: ML frameworks, KFP patterns, component structure
2. Load optional ML design documents:
   → ml-data-model.md: Extract ML components → component tasks
   → ml-contracts/: Each file → component test task
   → ml-research.md: Extract ML decisions → ML setup tasks
3. Generate ML tasks by category:
   → ML Setup: project init, ML dependencies, KFP SDK setup
   → ML Tests: component tests, pipeline integration tests
   → ML Core: components, pipelines, model handlers
   → ML Integration: KFP API, metadata, artifact storage
   → ML Polish: performance tests, documentation, examples
4. Apply ML task rules:
   → Different ML components = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same component file = sequential (no [P])
   → ML tests before implementation (TDD for ML)
5. Number ML tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate ML dependency graph
7. Create parallel ML execution examples
8. Validate ML task completeness:
   → All ML contracts have tests?
   → All components have implementations?
   → All pipelines have validation?
9. Return: SUCCESS (ML tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] ML Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different ML components, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths for ML components and tests

## ML Path Conventions
- **Pipeline components**: `components/[component-name]/`, `tests/components/`
- **SDK extensions**: `kfp_extensions/src/`, `tests/sdk/`
- **API enhancements**: `backend/src/`, `tests/api/`
- **Full pipelines**: `pipelines/[pipeline-name]/`, `tests/pipelines/`
- Paths shown below assume pipeline components - adjust based on plan.md ML structure

## Phase 3.1: ML Setup
- [ ] T001 Create ML project structure per implementation plan
- [ ] T002 Initialize KFP project with ML framework dependencies
- [ ] T003 [P] Configure ML linting tools (black, flake8, mypy)
- [ ] T004 [P] Set up KFP SDK and component validation tools

## Phase 3.2: ML Tests First (TDD) ⚠️ MUST COMPLETE BEFORE 3.3
**CRITICAL: These ML tests MUST be written and MUST FAIL before ANY implementation**
- [ ] T005 [P] Component test for [component-name] in tests/components/test_[component-name].py
- [ ] T006 [P] Component input validation test in tests/components/test_[component-name]_validation.py
- [ ] T007 [P] Pipeline integration test in tests/pipelines/test_[pipeline-name]_integration.py
- [ ] T008 [P] End-to-end pipeline test in tests/e2e/test_[pipeline-name]_e2e.py
- [ ] T009 [P] ML framework compatibility test in tests/compatibility/test_[framework]_integration.py

## Phase 3.3: ML Core Implementation (ONLY after tests are failing)
- [ ] T010 [P] ML component implementation in components/[component-name]/component.py
- [ ] T011 [P] Component Dockerfile in components/[component-name]/Dockerfile
- [ ] T012 [P] Component YAML specification in components/[component-name]/component.yaml
- [ ] T013 [P] ML pipeline definition in pipelines/[pipeline-name]/pipeline.py
- [ ] T014 [P] Model handling utilities in shared/utils/model_utils.py
- [ ] T015 Component parameter validation
- [ ] T016 ML artifact handling and metadata
- [ ] T017 Error handling and logging for ML workflows
- [ ] T018 Resource requirement specification

## Phase 3.4: ML Integration
- [ ] T019 Integrate with KFP metadata store
- [ ] T020 Configure artifact storage (MinIO/GCS/S3)
- [ ] T021 Set up ML model versioning
- [ ] T022 Configure pipeline execution monitoring
- [ ] T023 Implement multi-tenant isolation
- [ ] T024 Add GPU resource management

## Phase 3.5: ML Performance & Validation
- [ ] T025 [P] Performance tests for ML component execution time
- [ ] T026 [P] Resource usage validation tests
- [ ] T027 [P] ML model accuracy/quality validation
- [ ] T028 [P] Pipeline scalability tests
- [ ] T029 Cross-framework compatibility validation

## Phase 3.6: ML Polish
- [ ] T030 [P] Unit tests for ML utilities in tests/unit/test_ml_utils.py
- [ ] T031 [P] Update ML component documentation
- [ ] T032 [P] Create ML pipeline examples and tutorials
- [ ] T033 [P] Add ML monitoring and observability
- [ ] T034 Remove code duplication in ML components
- [ ] T035 Run ml-quickstart.md validation

## Dependencies for ML Tasks
- ML Tests (T005-T009) before implementation (T010-T018)
- T010 (component) blocks T011 (Dockerfile), T012 (YAML spec)
- T013 (pipeline) requires T010 (component) to exist
- T019-T024 (integration) require T010-T018 (core) to be complete
- Implementation before performance validation (T025-T029)
- Performance validation before polish (T030-T035)

## Parallel ML Example
```
# Launch T005-T009 together (different ML test files):
Task: "Component test for data-preprocessor in tests/components/test_data_preprocessor.py"
Task: "Component validation test in tests/components/test_data_preprocessor_validation.py"
Task: "Pipeline integration test in tests/pipelines/test_training_pipeline_integration.py"
Task: "End-to-end pipeline test in tests/e2e/test_training_pipeline_e2e.py"
Task: "TensorFlow compatibility test in tests/compatibility/test_tensorflow_integration.py"
```

## ML Notes
- [P] tasks = different ML component files, no dependencies
- Verify ML tests fail before implementing components
- Commit after each ML task completion
- Test with multiple ML frameworks when applicable
- Validate resource requirements and scaling

## ML Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution for ML features*

1. **From ML Contracts**:
   - Each component spec → component test task [P]
   - Each ML component → implementation task
   - Each pipeline → end-to-end test task

2. **From ML Data Model**:
   - Each ML component → component creation task [P]
   - ML artifact relationships → metadata tasks
   - Resource specifications → validation tasks

3. **From ML User Stories**:
   - Each ML workflow → integration test [P]
   - ML quickstart scenarios → validation tasks
   - Performance requirements → benchmark tasks

4. **ML Ordering**:
   - Setup → Tests → Components → Pipelines → Integration → Performance → Polish
   - ML dependencies block parallel execution
   - Framework compatibility tests run in parallel
